# Security

WebRA's online multiplayer is deterministic lockstep: every player runs the
same simulation, only orders travel, and the server (a Cloudflare Worker with
one Durable Object per game) relays and validates them without simulating.
That design shapes the threat model: anything that crashes one peer crashes
every peer, and every client necessarily holds the full game state.

## Review (2026-10-07)

A dedicated security review (Fable 5.1) covered the Worker API, the session
Durable Object, the protocol package, the engine's order, map and rules paths,
the browser client, the website and the CI/deploy setup. Findings and status:

| # | Severity | Finding | Status |
|---|----------|---------|--------|
| F1 | Critical | A `place` order with an out-of-range actor type made `place_building` index past the rules table; the panic aborted the engine on every peer. | Fixed: bounds check in the engine; the protocol caps type ids (`ACTOR_TYPE_MAX`); the server rejects orders naming types the engine does not have and drops the sender. Fuzz tests throw thousands of hostile orders (extreme coordinates, unknown ids, every variant, raw JSON) at the engine. |
| F2 | Medium | Rules overrides in modded maps only had type checks, so values such as `hp: 0` could divide by zero mid-game. | Fixed: the engine validates every merged rules value (ranges, table lengths, cross references) for every modded map, on the server at upload and on each client before play; silent normalisation of bad values was removed; divisions by data are defensive. A fuzz test plays modded games with random accepted overrides. |
| F3 | Low | One player could send a wrong state hash and make the server tell everyone the game desynced. | Fixed: hashes are compared once every active player reported; with a strict majority only the outliers are told, and only a real split warns everyone. |
| F4 | Low | No security headers on the site and game. | Fixed: `_headers` sets a strict Content-Security-Policy (no inline script; `wasm-unsafe-eval` for the engine), `frame-ancestors 'none'`, nosniff, referrer, permissions, COOP and HSTS. Inline scripts were moved to files and style attributes go through the CSSOM. |
| F5 | Info | The Origin check is CSRF protection, not authentication; a silent player stalls peers until dropped after 10 s. | Accepted (inherent to lockstep, bounded). |

## Inherent to lockstep

- **Map hack:** every client holds the whole simulation; fog of war is a
  client-side view. A modified client can reveal the map. Preventing this
  needs a server-authoritative simulation, which this design avoids. The wire
  carries only orders.
- **Shared fate:** an input that crashes one engine crashes all, which is why
  validation happens at the engine boundary (not only in the protocol) and is
  fuzz tested.

## What protects a game

- Orders are stamped with the sender's seat by the server and again by the
  engine (`apply_frame`); the engine re-checks unit ownership.
- Host privileges need a high-entropy host key, stored hashed; passwords are
  salted PBKDF2 with per-IP lockout; comparisons are constant time.
- Maps are identified by the SHA-256 of their canonical JSON, validated by the
  protocol package and by the engine itself (WebAssembly inside the Worker)
  before they are stored, and re-checked by every client after download. The
  MODDED flag is recomputed from content everywhere, never trusted from the
  wire, and players must accept the modded-map warning before installing.
- Rate limits per connection and per IP (`CF-Connecting-IP`), message size
  limits, strict message schemas, no `innerHTML` sinks for user text.
