# WebRA contracts

Shared agreements between the parts of the monorepo. Every part builds against
this document; change it first (in its own commit) when a contract has to move.

## 1. Layout and ownership

| Path | What | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| `engine/` | Rust simulation (`webra-sim`), compiled to WebAssembly | Deterministic, integer math only |
| `apps/game/` | Browser client, served at `https://webra.sherin.dev/play/` | ES modules, no bundler, WebGPU |
| `apps/game/editor/` | Map editor, served at `/play/editor/` | Same engine package for previews and test play |
| `apps/website/` | Landing site, served at `https://webra.sherin.dev/` | Static, no framework |
| `apps/server/` | Cloudflare Worker: static assets, HTTP API, Durable Objects | `wrangler.jsonc` lives here |
| `packages/protocol/` | Multiplayer message definitions and validators (plain JS) | Imported by `apps/game` and `apps/server` |
| `data/` | Red Alert catalog extracted from OpenRA | Input for `tools/gen_rules.py` |
| `tools/` | `gen_rules.py`, `shader-check`, `check-js.mjs` | |

The browser imports `packages/protocol` through the path `/play/protocol/` (the
build copies `packages/protocol/src` to `dist/play/protocol/`). In the repo
`apps/game/protocol` is a symlink to `../../packages/protocol/src`, and the game
imports it only through the re-export file `apps/game/js/protocol.js` (from
`../protocol/index.js`), so the same path works in local dev and in `dist/`.

## 2. Map format (`.webra-map.json`, format 1)

```jsonc
{
  "format": 1,
  "name": "Twin Rivers",            // 1..64 chars
  "author": "Commander",            // 1..64 chars
  "description": "",                // 0..500 chars
  "width": 96, "height": 96,        // 32..256 each
  "terrain": "<base64>",            // width*height bytes, row-major, values: 0 clear, 1 rough, 2 rock, 3 water, 4 tree
  "ore": "<base64>",                // width*height bytes, 0..12 ore density
  "spawns": [[8, 8], [85, 84]],     // 2..8 top-left cells of the starting construction yard / MCV
  "actors": [                       // optional pre-placed actors
    { "type": "SBAG", "owner": -1, "x": 40, "y": 40, "facing": 0 }  // owner: spawn index, or -1 for neutral
  ],
  "rules": null                     // optional rules overrides, see below
}
```

- Identity: `sha256` (hex) of the canonical JSON: top-level keys in the order
  above (`description`, `actors` and `rules` always present; `actors` entries
  as `type, owner, x, y, facing`), keys inside `rules` sorted alphabetically at
  every level, integers only, no whitespace. `Game.map_canonical(json)` returns
  exactly that string; JavaScript implementations must match it byte for byte
  (tests compare against the engine). The server and clients check the hash
  after every download.
- Size limit: 1 MiB serialized.
- `rules` overrides (the rules.ini story): a partial copy of `engine/rules.json`
  keyed by id: `{ "actors": { "1TNK": { "cost": 400, "unit": { "speed": 150 } } }, "weapons": { "25mm": { "range": 6000 } } }`.
  Deep-merged over the built-in rules before the game starts. Unknown ids or
  fields are rejected. **Any map with `rules` is a modded map**: the client
  shows a warning ("This map changes game rules (costs, damage, speed...). It
  can be unfair or act as a cheat.") and the player must accept before the map
  is installed. The lobby shows a MODDED badge for such maps.
- Engine API (landed): `Game.from_map(mapJson, optionsJson)` builds a world
  from a map (players fill spawns in slot order, extra spawns stay empty,
  neutral actors get a passive owner); `Game.map_hash(mapJson)`,
  `Game.map_canonical(mapJson)`, `Game.validate_map(mapJson)` returns
  `{ ok, errors: [], modded, hash }`; `Game.generated_map(seed, size, players)`
  exports a generated map file; previews: `Game.map_file_preview(mapJson)` and
  `Game.map_preview_players(seed, size, players)` (RGBA per cell, spawns in
  player colours).

## 3. Game options (lobby to engine)

`options` JSON as produced by `apps/game/js/lobby.js` (see that file for value
sets): `seed, mapSize, players[{slot, type: human|ai|closed, name, faction,
color, team, difficulty}], startingCash, startingUnits, techLevel, gameSpeed,
fog, explored, buildRadius, redeployableMcv, oreRegrowth`. `team` 0 means no
team (free for all); players with the same non-zero team are allies (shared
vision, no auto-targeting, win together). 2..8 players.

## 4. Online multiplayer

Deterministic lockstep: every client runs the same simulation; only orders
travel over the network. The server never runs the simulation.

### HTTP API (Worker)

| Method | Path | Body / result |
|--------|------|---------------|
| `GET` | `/api/version` | `{ version, protocol }` |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions` | `[{ id, name, host, players, maxPlayers, locked, map: { id, name, hash, modded }, version, state }]` (public, open lobbies only) |
| `POST` | `/api/sessions` | `{ name, password?, public, maxPlayers, version }` -> `{ id, hostKey }` |
| `GET` | `/api/sessions/:id/ws` | WebSocket upgrade into the session's Durable Object |
| `GET` | `/api/maps` | `[{ id, name, author, players, width, height, hash, modded, downloads, createdAt }]` |
| `GET` | `/api/maps/:id` | the map JSON |
| `POST` | `/api/maps` | map JSON -> `{ id, hash }` (validated, size limited, rate limited) |

### WebSocket messages (JSON, `{ "t": type, ... }`)

Client to server:

| t | Fields | When |
|---|--------|------|
| `hello` | `protocol, version, name, password?, hostKey?` | first message |
| `slot` | `slot, faction?, color?, team?, type?(host only: ai/closed/open), difficulty?` | lobby |
| `options` | `options` (host only) | lobby |
| `map` | `{ id, hash, name, modded }` (host only) | lobby |
| `ready` | `ready: bool, mapHash` | lobby (must have the map installed) |
| `chat` | `text` (<= 200 chars) | any time |
| `start` | (host only, everyone ready) | lobby |
| `orders` | `tick, orders: [...]` | in game, every tick (may be empty) |
| `hash` | `tick, hash` | in game, every 25 ticks |
| `leave` | | any time |

Server to client: `welcome {you, hostId, session}`, `lobby {slots, options, map}`,
`chat {from, text}`, `start {seed, options, map, players, delay}`, `frame
{tick, orders: [[player, [...]], ...]}`, `desync {tick}`, `left {player}`,
`error {code, message}`.

Rules: the server stamps the sender's player index on every order (clients
cannot send orders for others), validates every message against
`packages/protocol`, limits message size (8 KiB) and rate, compares hashes and
reports desyncs, and drops a player who stops sending orders for 10 s.
Passwords are stored as salted PBKDF2 hashes in the Durable Object. Order
delay: 3 ticks.

Engine side (landed): `Game.set_lockstep(true)` makes order methods queue into
an outbox; `Game.take_orders()` returns them as a JSON array of order objects
(`{"o": "move", ...}`, see `Order` in engine/src/world.rs); 
`Game.apply_frame('[[player, [order, ...]], ...]')` queues one frame before
`tick()` and re-stamps every order with that player index (invalid entries are
skipped, returns the count). `Game.state_hash()` (hex string) for desync
checks, `Game.player_count()`. Players: 2..8, `team` per player (0 = free for
all); `player_json` has `won`, `defeated` and `team`.

## 5. Domains for units

`engine` units move in a domain: `ground` (flow fields on land), `water` (flow
fields on water cells, naval yards are their docks) and `air` (free flight,
no pathfinding). Queue types: Building, Defense, Infantry, Vehicle, Aircraft,
Ship. Target classes: infantry 1, vehicle 2, structure 4, air 8, water 16.

### Helicopters (`engine/src/helicopter.rs`)

Built at the Helipad (HPAD) and start landed on it. VTOL: take off and land
vertically, hover in place when idle, turn in place, slide toward their goal.
Landed aircraft (altitude 0) count as vehicles for targeting (OpenRA
`Targetable@GROUND`), so anti-air cannot hit them and ground weapons can.
Idle armed helicopters hold fire (OpenRA `InitialStance: HoldFire`) and only
engage on attack-move or an attack order. Rounds are spent per shot; an empty
helicopter reserves a free helipad (one per pad), lands, reloads
`rearm_count` rounds every `rearm_delay` ticks (OpenRA AmmoPool) and takes
off again. Damaged helicopters land on the service depot to be repaired.
Shot down in the air they fall and explode on impact.

Orders (`Order` in engine/src/world.rs, validated by `packages/protocol`):
`{"o": "land", ids, x, y}` lands on or next to a cell (on an own helipad or
service depot: reload or repair there), `{"o": "return_to_base", ids}` flies
to a free helipad (a full helicopter only waits near the base), `deploy`
lands where the helicopter hovers or takes off again. A smart order on an own
helipad docks (cursor 4), on an own service depot repairs (cursor 5). Engine
API: `Game.order_land(player, ids, x, y)`, `Game.order_return_to_base(player,
ids)`; `actor_json` reports `ammo`, `maxAmmo` and `landed`.

Deliberate deviations from OpenRA (the `OVERRIDES` table in
`tools/gen_rules.py`):

- The Helipad is buildable by both sides (OpenRA: Allies only), as in classic
  Red Alert (1996), where the Soviets fly the Hind from it.
- The Hind is enabled for the Soviets (OpenRA: `~disabled`).
- The Black Hawk requires `structures.allies`, so it stays Allied as in
  OpenRA; the Chinook is available to both sides, as in classic Red Alert.

Not modelled: landed helicopters do not block ground units' paths.

## 6. Deployment

One Worker named `webra` on the `WebRA` Cloudflare account serves
everything on `webra.sherin.dev`:

- `/` and `/assets/*`: `apps/website` build output
- `/play/*`: `apps/game` (with `pkg/` from wasm-pack and `protocol/`)
- `/api/*`: the Worker's fetch handler (`apps/server/src`)

Build: `npm run build` assembles `dist/` (website at the root, game under
`play/`). Deploy: GitHub Actions `deploy.yml` runs `wrangler deploy` from
`apps/server` on every push to `main` after CI passes, using the repository
secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. Storage: Durable
Objects (SQLite) for sessions, D1 database `webra` for maps and the session
directory.
